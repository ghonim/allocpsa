Certain functionality in alloc can be accessed by POSTing requests to
http://alloc/services/json.php. Results will be returned in JSON.

The first step that must be performed is authentication:

    curl http://alloc/services/json.php --data \
      'client_version=1.8.3&authenticate=1&username=USERNAME&password=PASSWORD'

You should get a JSON encoded session id in response:

    {"sessID":"73ae3733d3492f356d4f5cd1c8634205"}

Future requests should use this session ID, to affirm your identity to alloc.

Now that we have a session ID, let's attempt to use one of the methods that is
in the services class (alloc/services/lib/services.inc.php). As documented here:
http://alloc/services/doc/services.html

Eg: get_task_comments(taskID), returns an array of all the comments for a
particular task. That functionality can be accessed like:

    curl http://alloc/services/json.php --data \
      'client_version=1.8.3&sessID=73ae3733d3492f356d4f5cd1c8634205&method=get_task_comments&taskID=TASKID'


Please note:

* The "taskID" name is specified in the methods arguments in the
  documentation.

* Clients should check for the possibility that their request has returned
  {"reauthenticate":"true"}, this will indicate that their session has expired
  and that the client should re-authenticate as specified above.

* Occasionally various methods will require an array of options to be passed across.
  That array should be JSON encoded.
