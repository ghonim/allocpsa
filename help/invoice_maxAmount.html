<b>Invoice Maximum Amount Allocated</b>
<br><br>

This is useful for when a client pays you (or says they're going to pay you) a
lump sum of money for a particular piece of work, and you want to ensure
that the people filling in time sheets for the work, do not exceed that amount.
<br><br>

The value that you input for the Amount Allocated, dictates that the sum of all
the time sheets that are a part of this invoice, shall not exceed a certain amount.
<br><br>

To use this functionality you need to setup things correctly:
<br><br>

a) create/edit a project, ensure the project is type PRE-PAID.
<br>
b) create an invoice for the project, set the Amount Allocated on the invoice to the lump sum amount.
<br><br>

Now when new time sheets are created for that project, they will automatically be
attached to the invoice.
<br><br>

When the people who are creating time sheets go to add more time, they should see a field on their time sheets which say eg:
<br><br>

Amount Used / Allocated: $1000 / $2000
<br><br>

This indicates that the sum of ALL the time sheets (for all the employees) across the project is
$1000, and that the invoice's total Amount Allocated is $2000.
<br><br>

This hopefully encourages timely filling in of time sheets (especially as
the funds start to run low), by providing an awareness of how much money
remains. Which will help prevent overspending.
