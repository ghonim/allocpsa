<b>Product</b>
<br><br>

The <b>Sell Price</b> is the amount that you are selling the Product for.
When this product is involved in a Sale, a transaction will be created that
moves the amount of the Sell Price from the Incoming TF to the Main Finance TF*.

<br><br><br>

If the Sell Price is tax inclusive, then during a Product Sale
there will be additional line items for the tax, and the resulting margin will
be lessened.


<br><br>
* Main Finance TF, if a Project is selected for the Product Sale, then the Sale
  will use the Projects TF, and if that's not set, then fall back to the Main
  Finance TF.
