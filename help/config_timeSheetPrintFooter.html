<u>Time Sheet Printout Footer</u>
<br><br>

When generating a PDF version of a Time Sheet it may be desireable to have a
customized footer. This footer could contain your organizations bank details
etc.  Basic html such as &lt;br&gt;, &lt;b&gt; and &lt;u&gt; are allowed
and will be rendered as expected in the PDF document (br means new line, b
means bold, u means underline. The b and u tags must encapsulate their content
with an ending tag eg: &lt;/b&gt;).
