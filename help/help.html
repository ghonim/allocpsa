<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>installing and using allocPSA in a commercial environment, in a commercial

<p>If you have the technical skill in-house or can hire them, you may be happy to
support and maintain this product on your own. However, allocPSA was developed
and is commercially supported by Cyber IT Solutions Pty. Ltd., based in Melbourne,
Australia.</p>
<p>Cyber IT Solutions has been providing commercial support since 1991 and has been
the allocPSA product developer and maintainer since 2000. As such, we can offer
your firm high-quality support. In addition, because allocPSA is open source
software, and any other competent web-development firm can also elect to offer
commercial support for it, Cyber IT Solutions must also offer great value in its
support services.</p>
<div class="section" id="customisation">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id12">6.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Customisation</a></h2>
<p>No two services businesses work the same way. To provide for this reality,
allocPSA was designed and is intended to be customised for each site. To that
end, Cyber IT offers your firm a complete customisation service, whereby
allocPSA can be optimised for your work processes, your firm's accounting and
billing practices and the software used to implement these, or any other
site-specific requirements.</p>
<p>If allocPSA does most of what your business needs but could benefit from
specific functionality to make it better integrate with your existing business
systems or processes, speak to us about a free quote to add those features into
allocPSA.</p>
<p>Alternatively, as allocPSA is completely open source, you can elect to make any
modifications in-house, or hire a third-party to make any modifications. You
are fully entitled to select either course of action.</p>

<p>If you do build extensions onto allocPSA, please consider donating these back

<li>You will be making a contribution back to the community, so that allocPSA
grows in capabilities and polish, with time.</li>
<li>You will reduce your level of burden by feeding your code changes back

<div class="section" id="introduction">
<h1><a class="toc-backref" href="#id16">7&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Introduction</a></h1>
<p>Welcome to the user-level documentation for allocPSA.</p>
<p>allocPSA is an on-line, web-based Professional Services Automation
system. allocPSA provides a suite of integrated applications designed for
organisations which provide services to Clients. It enables services personnel
to become more productive and profitable by increasing their efficiency through
increased utilisation and productive time, improved planning and integrated
knowledge management. It reduces the likelihood of slip-ups and increases the
traceability and manageability of projects, expenses, Tasks and people.</p>
<p>allocPSA can streamline the process of allocating staff resources to key
projects, managing strategic initiatives at a granular level, and can offer a
platform for process collaboration and knowledge reuse to any professional
services business.</p>
<p>allocPSA consists of numerous software modules for business areas such as:
resource planning, project management, time and expenses, fault &amp; issues
tracking, message, announcement, reminder and knowledge management,
collaboration, services supply chain, human resources and staff skilling and
certification, item loans and management of cost-centres. allocPSA offers
integration between the modules, as well as an open architecture and
integration with existing external invoicing, book-keeping and payroll systems.</p>
<p>allocPSA is intended for use in daily organisational operations, such as
client contact, project management, task and resource allocation, skills
tracking, time-sheeting, issues tracking, calendaring, reminders and
escalation, item loans, cost expenses and centres as well as integration with
existing external accounts and billing systems.</p>
<p>allocPSA is made available as a server-based appliance. By deploying an
allocPSA system into your network, all staff can access the application from
any networked computer which has a web browser. Depending on your network
configuration and security policies, staff can also access the allocPSA system
from external computers. Therefore, they can monitor Tasks and submit
Time Sheets from home, or from any Internet-access point around the world.</p>
<p>As a web-based application, users access allocPSA via the standard web-browser
they already have on their PCs. No software needs to be installed on their PCs.
Installation and maintenance of allocPSA is therefore a simple and
straightforward affair. The new server is installed and configured in hours and
all users' PCs are able to access the allocPSA application immediately.</p>
<p>allocPSA is open source software - you are provided with full access to the
complete source code under an open source licence. That means you have
open-ended usage and code modification access rights. This greatly reduces your
business risks in adopting allocPSA as a system element in your core business
operations. The product's source code will always be yours in perpetual code
escrow, at no additional cost.</p>
<div class="section" id="deployment">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id17">7.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Deployment</a></h2>
<p>allocPSA is supplied as in a number of 'formats':</p>

<h1><a class="toc-backref" href="#id18">8&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Installation and Configuration</a></h1>
<p>Once you've installed allocPSA, you must login and then change the default
login account password. You can do this by accessing the default account
through the People tab and supplying a new strong account password.</p>
<p>You should also update the allocPSA configuration settings, found by clicking
the 'Setup' link in the top right hand corner of the allocPSA toolbar. You can
get more information about each configuration item, by using the Help
squares to the right of each configuration option.</p>
<p>Update the allocPSA configuration information as soon as you can.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="features-benefits">
<h1><a class="toc-backref" href="#id19">9&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Features &amp; Benefits</a></h1>
<p>Modern businesses are quickly recognizing the need to make intelligent use of
information throughout the organization to better address support issues and
other business problems. allocPSA can help track and manage customer requests,
problems, complaints, Tasks and any other projects that need to be tracked.
Web-based action tracking offers the best and most simple way to gain control
over information, issues and Tasks for a group or department, or throughout an
organization worldwide.</p>
<p>With the increasing business requirement that information management
systems provide substantial and immediate return on investment, allocPSA
is the answer to many of your service-industry information management
concerns.</p>
<p>Among other features, allocPSA provides a comprehensive multilevel,
multi-project planning, scheduling and reporting engine scalable to thousands
of projects. The ability to search for qualified and available resources,
assign Tasks and manage staff with a powerful resource search engine across
single or multiple projects.</p>
<p>allocPSA also offers cost-control management and project graphical and
milestone-enabled Gantt-style bar chart reporting capabilities. This makes
allocPSA a valuable platform for managing the priorities and objectives that
drive your business.</p>
<p>Using proven project management disciplines and processes, allocPSA helps you
optimize resources and manage activities to meet project deadlines and budgets.</p>
<p>allocPSA automatically generates customizable outgoing email alerts to
instantly notify relevant assignees, managers and other people involved with
all aspects of service delivery. Daily email alerts, sent to all resources,
outlines that day's key Tasks and scheduled events, meetings and expectations.</p>
<p>A Task and reminder Calendar is available for all staff on entry into allocPSA,
via the Home page.</p>
<p>A filtering drill-down facility to resource (personnel) availability and
skilling makes it possible to determine which of your staff is suited for
particular Project and Tasks.</p>
<p>allocPSA provides a simple inventory and loans management module, a framework
for producing Project cost-estimators, a graphical chart representation of
historical and current business activity, as well as an open-ended and
customisable report generator which allows you to extract data to a web-page or
CSV file, ready for mail-merges or exporting.</p>

<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id49">10.14&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How do I Ensure Staff Effort on Tasks is Captured as Time Sheets?</a></h2>
<p>NOTE: allocPSA provides managers with the ability to add small comments
(or hints) to specific tasks, to assist them in tracking the work levels
on those tasks by staff. This can be useful in professional services
organisations as a truer representation of work-levels being allocated
to tasks, and thus in helping improve utilisation and this
client-billing. It does obviously mean that managers need to keep
regular tabs on staff activity, such that even if staff don't nominate
work effort on a task (via a time sheet entry), then a manager can make
a note to query the staff member about that effort.</p>
<p>NOTE: In order to make use of this facility, you need to have Manager
privileges and you also need to switch on the New Time Sheet Item Hint
option for your Home page. The New Time Sheet Item Hint feature provides
a text-entry box on the user's Home page. This will allow them to
quickly add indications (or hints) of what work different team members
are doing. To learn how to enable this feature, please refer to <a class="reference internal" href="#how-do-i-customise-my-home-page">How
do I Customise my Home Page?</a> .</p>

<li>Duration - in the standard time increments for that user (eg,
hours).</li>
<li>TaskID - the ID of the task that you want to add this hint for.</li>
<li>Comment - an optional note for your future reference.</li>
</ol>
<p>NOTE: As you're typing these details into the textbox, allocPSA will

the information block, showing you the details in a fuller-form.</p>

<p>NOTE: This tool is useful in hinting at (and perhaps capturing) 'time
effort' which is performed by staff, if the staff aren't transacting any
activities through allocPSA for that task. If, however, the staff are

but are still available just on the periphery. This might occur when
where you're waiting on information, or waiting on customer approval or
feedback. allocPSA provides a convenient way to manage such 'paused'

<li>Open the task (fault, message) that you would like to mark as
Pending.</li>
<li>From the Main (or All) task tab, click the Edit Task button. This
will open the task header section for editing. By default, a task is
Open: Not Started, until work has begun on a task.</li>
<li>Select the Pending option from the Status droplist. For example,
Pending: Info, which means that the task is in limbo while specific
information is sought, or Pending: Manager, which means that the task
awaiting the go-ahead from an allocPSA manager, or Pending: Client,
which means that the task is awaiting information or the go-ahead
from the Client associated with the task.</li>

<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id71">10.36&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How do I use the allocPSA Email Gateway?</a></h2>
<ol class="arabic">
<li><p class="first">Log in to allocPSA.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Ensure allocPSA and your webserver is configured to send and receive emails. (Setup -&gt; Email screen)</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Create a task, or open an existing task.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Create a comment and select which recipients you would like to receive your comment.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Hit the Save Comment button. Note that if you want to receive the
replies to that comment you will need to select your own name from the list of
recipients.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">You can also use certain keywords in your reply to access additional functionality via email.</p>
<p>The allocPSA task email subject lines currently look something like this:</p>
<p>[allocPSA] 12321 Task name goes here {Key:fds432fd}</p>
<p>When composing an email reply via your regular email client, you may
append certain keywords <em>after</em> the {Key:fdsfds} bit. The keywords are not
case-sensitive and can be in any order. You can use one-or-many of:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>sub subscribe</li>
<li>unsub unsubscribe</li>
<li>close pending open</li>
<li>notstarted inprogress info manager client invalid duplicate:1234 incomplete complete</li>
<li>quiet</li>
<li>3.25 (i.e. a number, to two decimal places)</li>
</ul>
<p>Sub/Subscribe adds you to that alloc task conversation. Unsub/unsubscribe
removes you from that conversation. Some text will be prepended to the
comment saying what has happened eg: &quot;Jonny Apple has been added to this
conversation&quot;.</p>
<p>Close closes the associated task. Open opens the task. And Pending makes the
task status pending. The Actual Completion date is filled or unfilled and the
Task Status moves to Closed:Completed or Open:In progress or Pending:Info.
The action is logged on the Task History tab.</p>
<p>If you want to exert finer control over the Task Status, you may use one of
the specific Task Sub-Status keywords: notstarted, inprogress, info,
manager, client, invalid, duplicate, incomplete or complete. If the task is to
be a duplicate, specify the duplicate task ID after a colon eg: duplicate:1234</p>
<p>Quiet means do not re-send this email. Previously only unsubscription
requests would <em>not</em> get re-sent. Now they <em>do</em> get re-emailed. You can
quell them with this &quot;quiet&quot; keyword. Likewise if you just want to add a
comment to the conversation thread without re-emailing everyone, quiet is
what you want.</p>
<p>A number. This number represents a time duration for a time sheet. This
way you can add time to a time sheet via email. If no time sheet exists,
one is automatically created. If you are not on the project, the time sheet
is still created and the time sheet item entry is still added, however your
rate will be set to zero, and you will have to fix it manually.
Additionally some text will be prepended to the top of the comment which
says eg &quot;Danielle Johnston has added 2.00 Hours to time sheet #34232.&quot; and/or
&quot;Danielle Johnston has not been added to project #22&quot;.  The body of the email is
added as the time sheet item comment. So it is best to keep the email
short. It probably makes sense to add the quiet keyword when adding time.</p>
<p>So if you reply to alloc with an email that has a subject line like this:</p>
<p>[allocPSA] 12321 Task name goes here {Key:fds432fd} 3.25 quiet close</p>
<p>then:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>3.25 (hours/days/or whatever is specified at the project level) are added to your time sheet.</li>
<li>No email is re-sent to people.</li>
<li>The task is closed.</li>
</ul>
<p>or eg this:</p>
<p>[allocPSA] 12321 Task name goes here {Key:fds432fd} open unsub 10</p>
<p>then:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Task is re-opened (if it was closed).</li>
<li>You are removed from that task conversation.</li>
<li>10 hours/days/etc are added to your time sheet for that task.</li>
</ul>
<p>The system uses your From address to identify you. If you don't use a
from address that is recognized by alloc then your commands are mostly
ignored. However if the {Key:} is correct the comment will
still be added. So for example if a client sticks random numbers in the
subject line, it's not going to randomly create time sheets, but the
comment will still come across.</p>
<p>Everything up to the {Key:sfdsffs} is actually ignored, so the email could just look
like this:</p>
<p>To: <a class="reference external" href="mailto:alloc&#64;somewhere.com.au">alloc&#64;somewhere.com.au</a>
From: <a class="reference external" href="mailto:ben&#64;otherplace.com.au">ben&#64;otherplace.com.au</a>
Subject: {Key:fds432fd} close 3</p>
<p>All emails that alloc receives are stored and are available for
download (if need be) from the UI same as usual, headers intact. Ideally
you are also storing your sent-mail which should make reconciliation a
little easier. alloc also stores a new field on the back-end that tracks
which emails are responsible for which time sheet items.</p>

<p>Note: allocPSA supports cost-centres (also-known-as tagged-funds) for
projects and staff. These allow for the tracking and movement of monies
within an organisation and amongst an organisation's project and staff
'boundaries'. tagged-funds are used to determine and track expenses,
time sheets, etc. Some people, particularly Admin and Manager users, may
need to track many such tagged-funds at once. As such, thay may find it
useful to have those particular tagged-funds display their current
account balance on the 'home' page. To make this happen, follow these
steps.</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Log in to allocPSA.</li>
<li>Go to the Tools tab of the main menu.</li>
<li>From the Finance list, click the List of Tagged Funds link. The
Tagged Funds list will appear, but it make take a while, as allocPSA
has to perform quite a few calculations.</li>
<li>If the list is too long, you can expand the Filter to allow you to
drill-down into the tagged funds you're interested in. To do so,
click the Show Filter link, near the top right.</li>
<li>When you find the tagged fund that you want to add an account-balance
view of in your 'home' page, click the Edit TF link, at the right of
the selected tagged fund.</li>
<li>Once inside the tagged fund, you will notice that it offers you a
drop-list to your name as one of the tagged fund owners, in the
TF owners section of the page. Once you've selected your name from
the list, click the Add button.</li>
<li>You can now check that this additional tagged-fund/cost-centre is
visible to you from your 'home' page, by clicking on the Home tab of
the main menu, and checking that the new tagged fund account balance
is being displayed in the Tagged Funds content block near the top
right.</li>

<p>There are a number of pages in allocPSA which display financial data.
Most of these relate to work arranged by managers or admin staff, and
are accessed infrequently or under specific circumstances. There is also
potentially sensitive financial data on each user's Home page. allocPSA
therefore provides a method to obfuscate this sensitive data, if the
user deems that necessary. To instantiate this obfuscation, the user
needs to:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Log in to allocPSA.</li>
<li>Click on the People tab from the main menu.</li>
<li>Click on your name from the list of names presented. This will open
up you Person Details personal settings page.</li>
<li>On the right of the Person Details page, you will see the Preferences
section; Click the Edit button within this section.</li>
<li>Switch on the private mode by selecting Yes in the Private Mode

<p>allocPSA gives you the ability to add specific records (such as Tasks,
Clients, Projects, Timesheets, Sales and Invoices) to the Star list.
These can then be accessed in a collective 'bookmarks' page, by clicking
the 'star' icon tool, located in the top right section of the main menu,
near the Help, Setup and Logout links.</p>
<p>To add new Star list bookmaks:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Log in to allocPSA.</li>
<li>Go to the specific data item that is of interest, for example a Task,
or a Client record. Alternatively, click into the Clients, Tasks,
Projects, Time, Invoices or Sales tab, to display the corresponding
list for that type.</li>
<li>If on a specific record, for example a single Task, you will notice a
small 'star' icon, near the top right of that item's menu. Click on
that small 'star' icon. This will fill the icon with a solid colour.
This indicates that this record is now in your Star list of
bookmarks. If you click that filled-in 'star' icon once more, it will
toggle-off the bookmark.</li>
<li>If you're looking a list of Tasks for instance, you will see a list
of 'star' icons along the right edge of the table. Clicking on any of
these will toggle the 'stars' on (filled) or off (empty),
corresponding to that item being in or out of your Star bookmark list.</li>
<li>To view your Star list of bookmarks, click on the main 'filled in'
star icon, near the top right of your main screen's menu items.</li>
<li>This will open the Star list, showing you all your various bookmarks
for the different types of items that you've bookmarked.</li>
<li>To remove an item from your Star bookmark list, click (that is,
uncheck) the 'filled in' star associated with that item (on the far
right of that item's entry in the table). This will toggle-off the
bookmark. If you refresh the page, or click on the Star list icon (near
the top right of your main screen's menu items) again, the item you
had unchecked should no longer be present. You're always welcome to
find that item again, and add it to your Star list of bookmarks.</li>

<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id89">10.54&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How do I Manage Support and Help Desk Tasks</a></h2>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: Some help-desk systems call suppprt tasks 'tickets'. In this
documentation, tickets and tasks can be used inter-changeably.  While there are
no functional differences between tasks assigned in 'help-desk' type projects
or tasks assigned to more traditional 'life-cycle' projects, these are
sometimes managed differently, or by different people within an organisation.
Help-desk tasks/tickets are generally created and managed on an ad-hoc and
on-going basis, and help-desk tasks are oft-times managed by more than one
person within an organisation. The nature of the processes used to manage such
tasks is therefore related to these attributes.</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Log in to allocPSA.</li>
<li>As a help-desk manager, you are likely to want to manage all, or some
portion of the currently active open support tickets. You can best do this by
going to the Task tab.</li>
<li>Within the Task list page, click on the Show Filter link, along the
top-right of the page.</li>
<li>Within this filter, click the Projects link, situated just above the list of
projects. This will expand the different categories of Projects.</li>
<li>From this list, click the Current option. This will then show you all the
current, active, open projects.</li>
<li>To display all the relevant tasks, either select <em>all</em> of the projects
listed, or de-select them all, so that none are high-lighted in the list.</li>
<li>To see the currently active tasks, select Open from the Task Status drop-list.</li>
<li>To view the fault tasks/tickets, select Fault from the Task Type list.</li>
<li>If you want to further filter down into particular task attributes, you can
choose these from the Created By, Managed By and Assigned To drop-lists. If you
don't have requirements for further filtering, leave these blank.</li>
<li>You can now select to see a variety of fields on the list of tasks to be filtered. For instance, if you want to see all the details of each task, you can check the Desc &amp; Comments. The following gives you more information about each of these options:</li>
</ol>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Desc &amp; Comments: This will show you the description of each task listed, along with all the comments. <strong>Note</strong> Use this option carefully, as the volume of data may be substantial. In general, unless you know there are only a few tasks in the returned task list, don't check this checkbox.</li>
<li>Task Dates: This gives you additional information on each task's Target Start, Target Completion,  Actual Start, Actual Completion and Task Created dates.</li>
<li>Task Creator: This will display the name of the user who created each task</li>
<li>Task Manager: This will display the name of the user who is set up on the task as the task manager.</li>
<li>Est, Act &amp; Percent: This will display information on the task's time
Estimate, the Actual time time-sheeted thus far, and the overall percentage
of the time time-sheeted versus the estimate. <em>If</em> the amount of time
time-sheeted for this task is more than the time estimated, then the percentage
will be displayed in <strong>red</strong>.</li>
<li>Assigned To:  This will display the name of the user who this task is assigned to.</li>
<li>Priority Info: This will display each task's Project and Task priority, along
with an overall computed Priority, based on the age of the task, attributed
priorities, etc.</li>
<li>Date Status: This will display a computed date estimate to complete the task,
based on effort and time spent thus far. A typical output would be something
like 'Started 2010-06-30, forecast completion date of 2010-12-06'.</li>
</ul>
<ol class="arabic simple" start="11">
<li>You can also select to filter based on Task Date attributes, by selecting items from the Task Date droplist. Options include:</li>
</ol>
<ul class="simple">
<li>New Tasks:</li>
<li>Due Today:</li>
<li>Overdue:</li>
<li>Date Created and then supply a data range on which to filter:</li>

<li>Estimated Start and then supply a data range on which to filter:</li>
<li>Estimated Completion and then supply a data range on which to filter:</li>

<li>Date Completed and then supply a data range on which to filter:</li>
</ul>
<ol class="arabic simple" start="12">
<li>Once all the filter options have been selected, click the Filter button.
This will generate the list of tasks which match your filter criteria and
display the information on those tasks, based on your output options.</li>
<li>The resulting table can be sorted on particular columns, for instance, task
ID or task Priority, in the usual manner, by clicking on the column header.
Click twice to reverse the sort order.</li>
<li>You can 'drill-down' into specific tasks, by clicking on their corresponding task name.</li>
<li>Using this Tasks page, you can filter and sort the tasks and faults which

<h1><a class="toc-backref" href="#id98">12&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Useful Tips for using allocPSA</a></h1>
<p>Firstly, remember that allocPSA is a web-based application. As such, all the
normal behaviour that you would expect from a web-browser functions correctly
in allocPSA. Therefore:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>When you are viewing a page which is larger than the web-browser window, you
can always scroll down (and up) with the scrollbar or Page Up or Page Down
on your keyboard.</li>
<li>You can print a whole (or part) page to any printer your workstation has
been configured to use, at any time, just like you would print a web-page.
If you see a &quot;Print&quot; link at the top of the screen that indicates that that
particular pages have been optimised for printing.</li>
<li>You can find any piece of text in a page by using your browser's page Find
function (often a Ctrl + F keystroke or available from the Edit menu)</li>
<li>You can save the complete contents of a page to a file, for later review, by
using your browser's Save Page As... function (often a Ctrl + S keystroke or
available from the Edit menu)</li>
<li>You can trace your steps back to any specific point that you have been
during this session, by using your browser's Back button (or function, often
accessed via a Ctrl + Left Keyboard Arrow)</li>
<li>You can establish specific browser Bookmarks for particular, commonly used
Projects, Tasks or function pages in allocPSA</li>
<li>You can (with some care) send others within your organisation the current
web-browser address (i.e. URL) of a particularly interesting page in
allocPSA that you want them to see.</li>
<li>Your organisation can make some parts of allocPSA available to outsiders,
via an extranet system, which may help them better understand how their
Project with your firm is progressing.</li>
<li>You can Bookmark pages in your web-browser. For example, if you
establish a specific filter, with options, for showing Tasks,
bookmark it, and recall the same filter settings on future occasions.</li>
<li><strong>Note</strong> It is a good idea to bookmark at least allocPSA one page in your
web-browser, and this should be your regular, 'safe' and 'sane' view of tasks,
perhaps the list of currently open Faults or active and open Tasks, with
minimal output fields selected. The main reason to create such a book mark is
that if, by some chance, you select to display a very large result set, by
selecting perhaps too much output, or too liberal a filter, there could be a
huge volume of data returned. In some web-server &lt;-&gt; web-browser combinations,
this might cause timeouts. If you do find yourself in such a scenario, you can
use your 'sane' bookmark, to 'reset' the task filter into something manageable.</li>

<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id99">12.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A Note on Dates in allocPSA</a></h2>
<p>As this system is intended for use in multiple countries, it has been designed

<h1><a class="toc-backref" href="#id101">13&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;allocPSA Tab Menu</a></h1>
<p>The tab menu in allocPSA is at the top of every page of the application. It
is perhaps the most often used component of the allocPSA application. From this
tab bar, you will be able to jump directly to almost all of the main
application modules (Home, Projects, Clients, Tasks, Finances, etc.) There is
also a search facility with which you will be able to look for almost all
important data-sets archived in allocPSA. Finally, there is also an Quick List,
from which, you will be able to create new Tasks, Project, Client entries, as

<p>The Home page is a convenient one-stop spot for you to determine the status of
your Tasks, calendar, cost-centre(s), pending work items, messages, Time Sheets
and any organisation-wide announcements that have been made. For really simple
usage, can operate much of allocPSA from the main screen; many of the other
top-level screens are often function-specific enhancements of the Home screen.</p>

complete, target completion etc.</p>
<p>The Tasks should be listed with the Task title (or name), the Project that the
Task belongs to, and the completion status (for example overdue for

<h3><a class="toc-backref" href="#id106">13.1.4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cost Centres &amp; TF (Tagged Fund)</a></h3>
<p>allocPSA uses the concept of Cost Centres (called Tagged Funds or just TFs) to
show the maintain and track the financial state of each Project's or Person's
accounts.</p>
<p>As a Professional Services Automation system, allocPSA must keep track of both
the expenses and revenues of a Project as well as cost-centres for individual
consultants and resources. It does so with a form of cost centre called a
tagged fund (TF for short). In this home page view, a user will be shown
their own personal cost centre account balance, as well as the present balance
of any Projects they have been allocated to oversee financially.</p>
<p>Click the account name you want to view in greater detail, and you will be
taken to that account. The account information page is described in detail
elsewhere in this document, but suffice to say that it displays and behaves
very much like an online bank account statement, with money being debited and
credited for any number of other accounts and source, reflecting the generation
and processing of Time Sheets, billable hours, Expense Forms and financial
injections from external systems like invoicing etc.</p>

<img alt="images/client_list.gif" src="images/client_list.gif" />
<p class="caption">List(s) of current, potential and archived Clients are
shown in the Clients section of allocPSA</p>
</div>
<p>All Professional Services Organisations (PSO) have a notion of Clients. This
normally includes all main companies and organisations that the PSO has contact
with. allocPSA has the ability to track all current, potential and archived
(i.e. lapsed) Clients. Besides the core organisational information, any number
of contacts can also be entered for each organisation tracked. The information
maintained includes the Client Name, Contact Name, Contact Phone, Contact
E-mail etc.</p>
<p>allocPSA also allows for the attachment of documents which pertain to this
Client, as well as any per-Client reminders that need to be added.</p>
<p>To view the list of current Clients, you need to click on the 'Clients'
tab in the allocPSA main menu. You will then be taken to the Clients tab
page, where you will be shown a table of current Clients.</p>
<p>You can filter the list of clients shown in the Clients tab page, by
clicking the Show Filter link, if this is presented, which will open up
the filter segment of the page. Using this filter, you can select
portions of a client name or a contact name within a client
organisation, which you want to filter on, along with the client's
Status (Current, Potential, Archived) and the client's Category (Client,
Vendor, Supplier, Non-profit, etc).</p>
<p>Once you have selected the filter criteria, you click the Filter button,
and allocPSA will show you the matching entries. You can remove a
filter, by clearing out the values in the filter text boxes, and
clicking the Filter button once more.</p>
<p>You can also using the alphabetic quick-links shown at the bottom of the
filter segment, to show all the client organisations which start with
A, B, C etc.</p>
<p>You can view and edit details for each Client, by clicking on that
client's link.</p>
<p>Hint: When allocPSA lists the list of current Client's, you can use your
browser's Find facility (often a Ctrl + F keystroke or available from the Edit
menu) to find any piece of text in this page. Thus, if you know that the
surname of the contact that you want is Purcell, you can quickly locate this
contact and jump straight to that contact's details on this Client list page.</p>
<p>If you want to view the list of Potential Clients, you can change the drop-list
which specifies Client type, and press the 'Filter' button. The same process
can be used to list All or Archived Clients.</p>
<p>Hint: If you have nominated a primary contacts for a Client, then that primary
contact's details will be shown in the Client listing. If those details include
an email address, that email address will be hyperlinked, so that you can click
on it to send that person mail, straight from within your mail Client.  You
will note that much like Task and Project forms, the Client forms have a header
component, as well as the body or main component. The header is used to store
information for the company or organisation which is common to all of the
contacts, such as headquarters address details, main switch and fax number.</p>

<div class="figure">
<img alt="images/project.gif" src="images/project.gif" />
<p class="caption">A Project's header information.</p>
</div>
<p>A Project is a logical entity which is constituted by one or more
people/resources/personnel working on one or more Tasks. Most Professional
Services firms have very specific examples of what constitutes a Project. It
might be implementing a new computer system for their own use or for a Client.
It might be in the production of a report, or the development of a new device
or item of software. allocPSA is very flexible in terms of how it handles the
concept of a Project, and how the life-cycle of a Project is handled in your
organisation.</p>
<p>To see a list of Projects in allocPSA, click on the Projects tab on the
main menu. This will show you a tabulated view of (most likely) the
currently active projects.</p>
<p>You can filter the list of projects shown in the Projects tab page, by
clicking the Show Filter link, if this is presented, which will open up
the filter segment of the page. Using this filter, you can select to
filter projects by Status (Current, Potential, Archived), Type (Project,
Job, Contract), allocated to a particular person, and portions of a
project's name.</p>
<p>Once you have selected the filter criteria, you click the Filter button,
and allocPSA will show you the matching entries. You can remove a
filter, by clearing out the values in the filter text boxes, and
clicking the Filter button once more.</p>
<p>Much like a Task, a Project has a header component, which is not likely to
change that frequently. Within this header component are informational details
about a the Project, including the Project's name, who the Client is,
Project-specific details about the Client's contact person, a number of start
and finish dates, along with Project budget details, Project manager (for
Time Sheet sign off purposes) and a Project modification history.</p>
<p>Once the header has been defined and saved, you will be able to set any
per-Project assignment of Commission (used for tracking revenues to account
managers of salespeople within your firm.) You can also establish which
resources/personnel are assigned to work on this Project. Unless a resource is
assigned to a Project, they will not be able to view it or its attendant Tasks
and phases (unless they have manager security privileges.) When establishing
the staff resources who will work on this Project, you can also specify what
their charge rates are to be.</p>
<p>allocPSA allows for the flexible management of in-house per-Project rates, as
well as externally charged rates which then bring revenues into particular
staff, Project or departmental cost-centres (known as Tagged Funds or TFs).</p>
<p>allocPSA also allows you to upload (and attach) any type of electronic document
to this Project's repository, as well as establish Project-specific Reminders.</p>
<p>The header information which can be specified, is listed below:</p>

<tr><td>Type</td>
<td>Which should be either Contract, Job or Project. Most Professional
Services firms perform work on either a Contract (support contract,
long-term ongoing work or staff on-site basis), Job (short term work or
consultancy) or Project (multi-person, with specified beginning, middle
and end, and more likely to be fixed cost and on a timeline with
milestones and deliverables.) If you select a Project, allocPSA
establishes a number of boilerplate phases, which you can use, extend
or delete as you deem fit.</td>

<tr><td>Client</td>
<td>The name of the Client which may have already been added to allocPSA's
Client database, or ,if new, can be added by clicking &quot;New Client&quot;.
Remember, many Projects and jobs are for internal Clients. As such,
your internal Clients should be added in allocPSA's Client database

such as AUD, USD, NZD, CAD etc. This figure is used to determine the
percentage of Project budget which has presently been spent, which is a
useful metric for Project managers and the professional service firm's
management. For example, if only half the Project has been completed,
and 60%of the budget has been spent thus far, there are likely to be
budget constraint or blow-out problems further down the track.</td>

<p>A Project is constituted by one or more people/resource undertaking numerous
Tasks. Tasks can be active (i.e. not-complete) or archived (i.e. completed).
Normally, allocPSA's Project page will only show you the current (i.e. active

commissions are tracked on a per-Project basis. Each Project has the facility
for the Project's owner to establish one or more staff/resources from your
organisation, who will receive the sales commission. To add a percentage
commission to a specified staff member, select their name from the drop-list at

forms of electronic document are supported (PDF files, ASCII, HTML, all
graphics files, MS Word, Powerpoint, Excel, MDF files and OpenOffice to name
but a few.) These documents are then displayed in a list on the Project page,
and can be downloaded or viewed very easily and quickly. Further, if your

Open-style dialog box (depending on your web-browser) with which you can
navigate to the document that you want to upload to allocPSA's document
repository. When you have selected the file you want to upload, and are back to
allocPSA's Project page, you should see the file path specified in the

<p class="caption">A Task can have its specific details, reminders and comments</p>
</div>
<p>A Task is a unit of work or a work requirement which needs to be accomplished.
Tasks normally relate to specific Projects. Tasks normally have start and
finish dates. Most Tasks are normally allocated to one specific user (i.e. a user
resource in Project management parlance). Tasks can have associated
descriptions, as well as priorities, and can be part of other Tasks or of
Phases. Tasks can also have a number of user created comments, which can
provide a running history of the Task.</p>
<p>A Task can have Reminders associated with it which can be set to email the
specified owner of the Task, or others within that Project, on certain dates
and at certain times.</p>
<p>Once a Task has been completed, it can be marked off as 100% done. It will then
be archived within the Project, available in a Complete Task List, but not
shown in the normal operational view of the Project. This reduces the overall
clutter.</p>
<p>A Phase is a special kind of Task, whose primary purpose is to contain other
Tasks. Examples of a phases might be 'Documentation' or 'Testing' or 'Planning'
or 'Contract Negotiation'. There is generally little different between a Task
and a phase, except that a phase will be displayed differently in the Task
List when doing a 'List by Project'.</p>
<div class="section" id="special-tasks-faults">
<h3><a class="toc-backref" href="#id136">13.4.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Special Tasks: Faults</a></h3>
<p>In allocPSA a fault is a special kind of Task which can be tracked specifically
as the entity which relates to help-desk activities within allocPSA.</p>
<p>Outside this change in task 'type', faults are actioned, managed and behave
like any standard task.</p>
<p>Note: When you create a fault, you have the option of establishing an automated
reminder for the assignee. The priority of the fault will determine how
frequently these reminder emails are sent.</p>
<p>While allocPSA does not purport to be a full Service Desk solution, the

presented with a view which primarily shows the header information. Once this
is saved, and from that point on, viewing that Task should show you the normal
operational view of the Task, with much of the header information now made
read-only.</p>
<p>You can now process the Task through its normal workflow, by adding comments
upon each atomic action of the Tasks history, updating the percentage complete
and eventually closing the Task off when it's been fully realised or judged
complete. Finally, you can view a Task with its full details displayed on
screen at once (referred to as the printer-friendly view, as its the most
conducive to grabbing a hard-copy snapshot of the Task in totality.</p>

<p class="caption">Task header, allowing you to specify the Project, Task name, description, interested parties and dates.</p>
</div>
<p>Tasks have two views. The first view is the header view, where you can
establish a number of attributes which are normally immutable (or change rather
infrequently.) The header view shows only a limited subset of all the
information which is normally associated with a Task. Once you have supplied
whatever information you have and ensured that the Task has a name, you should
then be able to Save the header component, and allocPSA will then take this

<tr><td>Task Type</td>
<td>Select a Task type; Task, phase, message or fault. A phase is handled
much the same as a Task, but displayed in different colour in charts.
Messages and faults are handled differently, Some Tasks or phases are (or have) milestones. For example,
code releases or document deliverables. As such, they need to be clearly
displayed as important date-points in online graphs. Setting a milestone
for this Task will result in a special vertical bar to be drawn in the
Project Graph.</td>

<tr><td>Interested Parties</td>
<td>allocPSA allows you to specify which other members of the Project (which
the Task belongs to) as well as any Client contacts listed for the
nominated Project Client, should be included in automated emails which
are sent. This is a great way to keep a whole team of in-house and
external resource briefed on the Task status.  NOTE: Naturally, your and
your staff need to be mindful of what messages are sent to these
external resources.</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>Time Estimate Hours (Best/Worst/Expected)</td>
<td>Time estimated to finish this Task. It is measured in terms of hour
units. This figure helps allocPSA produce Project timeline estimates and
forecasts. It does not need to be the same as the final time effort
which results in an entry in a Time Sheet.</td>

<p>The Time Sheet system in allocPSA allows for creation and management of
Time Sheets by users. This Time Sheet system is built around a workflow model
which is established as a 'factory default' when allocPSA is first installed.
This model works as follows.</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Time Sheets are created by staff/personnel/resources who have accounts in
allocPSA</li>
<li>Once the Time Sheet has been created and Tasks and hours have been added to
it, it can be sent to the next person in the workflow queue.</li>
<li>Who this next person is depends on a number of factors and default rulesets
established in the ruleset and configuration of allocPSA when it's
installed.</li>
<li>By default, if the Project in which the Time Sheet was created in has a
Time Sheet Manager specified, then the Time Sheet will get routed to that
manager. An email will also be sent to that manager to notify of a pending
Time Sheet.</li>
<li>If this manager verifies all the data and times in the Time Sheet, they can
elect to send it onwards to the administrative officer, nominally the staff
member who handles office or financial administration. An email will also be
sent to that administrative officer to notify of a pending Time Sheet</li>
<li>If the manager disputes any of the details in the Time Sheet, the manager can
add a notice in the Time Sheet, and elect to send it back to the user who
created the Time Sheet for its rectification and re-submission.</li>
<li>If no Time Sheet Manager is specified within the Project, then the Time Sheet
will automatically be routed to the user who has been specified in the
configuration of allocPSA as the administrative officer, nominally the staff
member who handles office or financial administration. An email will also be
sent to that administrative officer to notify of a pending Time Sheet</li>
<li>If the administrative officer disputes any of the details in the Time Sheet,
the administrative officer can add a notice in the Time Sheet, and elect to
send it back to the user who created the Time Sheet for its rectification and
re-submission.</li>
<li>At any stage, a user has the option of sending an ado-hoc comment, from the
time-sheet, in a manner similar to comments email sent from tasks.</li>
<li>Similarly, a user has the option of sending the contents of this
time-sheet, as either a PDF or as a HTML attachment, in a manner similar to
comments email sent from tasks, with attachments.</li>

</div>
<div class="section" id="fixed-costs">
<h3><a class="toc-backref" href="#id151">13.7.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fixed Costs</a></h3>
<p>Fixed Product Costs are the list of monetary transactions that will be created
whenever this Product is sold. They specify a particular amount that will be
transferred between TF's, and may be used to represent certain known expenses
that are generated every time there is a Sale of this Product.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="percentage-commissions">
<h3><a class="toc-backref" href="#id152">13.7.3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Percentage Commissions</a></h3>
<p>Each Product has a Buy Cost (the amount that you pay to acquire the item), and
a Sale Price (the amount that you charge the customer). The difference between
these two amounts is the Margin/Profit of the Sale.</p>
<p>The margin/profit from each sale can be distributed based on any Percentage
Commissions that you set up. For example you might specify that 10% of the
profit from each Sale of a particular Product, should go to Alice, perhaps for
a finders fee.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="meta-tf-s">
<h3><a class="toc-backref" href="#id153">13.7.4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Meta TF's</a></h3>
<p>When specifying the Product Costs and Commissions, it is possible to select
from the various particular TF's that the transactions should occur between.</p>
<p>There are also Meta TF's that may be auto-calculated for each sale. There is
the &quot;Meta: Project TF&quot;, which defaults to the relevant Project (if any), TF. If
no project is specified as part of this Sale, then this Meta TF will fall back
to whatever you have specifed as the &quot;Main Finance TF&quot;.</p>
<p>The &quot;Meta: Salesperson TF&quot; allows you to specify transactions that should occur
for the TF of the person who created the Sale. This gives you an easy way to
set up a commission for the person who makes the Sale.</p>

<p>If Sale Price is including Tax, then when a Sale is

<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id158">13.9&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wiki</a></h2>
<p>The Wiki in allocPSA is a user-generated knowledgebase and communal
book. Its interface and syntax will be familiar to anyone who has
created or managed documentation or content on a wiki on similar content
systems.</p>
<p>After clicking the Wiki tab from the main tab menu, you will be
presented with WIKI TREE content block, which sits on the left-hand side
of the screen. This shows the current documents available in the wiki,
along with any folders/sub-folders/directories. You can select any of
the content items, or folders, by clicking on them.</p>
<p>On the right is the HISTORY content block, which will present a list of
change actions for the selected content item/wiki page.</p>
<p>In the middle is the wiki display area, which will show the marked-up
wiki page rendering of your selected content item. You can click on any
wiki page from the WIKI TREE, and it will appear here.</p>
<p>To edit the wiki content item, click the 'Edit' button just beneath the
content display area. This will open the content item in a text-editing
area, and present a simple wiki-text markup toolbar across the top of
this area.</p>
<p>You can now add or modify the content text as you like. If you're
familiar with wiki syntax, you can insert it directly. Alternatively,
you can use the markup toolbar to insert the markup syntax into the text
area. You can also start by using the toolbar to insert items, and learn
the wiki syntax as you progress - it's quite simple.</p>
<p>As an example, to enter text as a top-level heading, click the <em>H1</em>
toolbar button. This will insert sample marked-up heading text in the
current cursor position in the text editing area, and highlight the
sample text which you will need to replace with your own.</p>
<p>You may also notice that many of toolbar buttons have keyboard
accelerators - simply hover your mouse cursor over one of these buttons
to see the corresponding help tooltip. For example, the <em>H1</em> toolbar
button uses the Ctrl + 1 keyboard accelerator. <em>H2</em> uses Ctrl + 2, etc.
To insert <strong>bold</strong> text, you can use Ctrl + B, <em>italic</em> is Ctrl + I and
so forth.</p>
<p>You can preview the changes you've made, without having to commit them,
by clicking the <em>Preview</em> toolbar button. The preview page will be
presented below your text-editing area.</p>
<p>Once you've added your first markup, you can continue with your editing,
adding additional content and markups.</p>
<p>When done, you can save your changes by clicking the 'Save' button just
below your text editing area.</p>
<p>Also, you should always consider adding a few words of text explaining
the nature of your changes to this wiki page. Add these in the
single-line text box, just below the wiki page text editing area.</p>
<p>Once you've saved your modified wiki page, you will be shown a rendered
version, and the modification note outlining the nature of the changes
will appear in the HISTORY section on the right, along with the name of
the allocPSA making the changes (i.e., you) and the date-time of this
change.</p>
<p>Note that to make the HISTORY functionality work, you will need to have a
file version control system installed on the server. Currently allocPSA
supports git, mercurial or darcs for its VCS. Out of the box allocPSA is
configured to try and use git. The config option called wikiVCS controls which
VCS is used.</p>

information about how to write markdown wikis here:
<a class="reference external" href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/">http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/</a></p>
<p>We've added some additional extensions to cover syntax for links and
maps.</p>
<p>Here's a quick primer on <em>markdown</em>:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Headings of various levels can be made by following the heading title
with an 'underlining' line of characters, such as: ~, -, _, etc.</li>
<li>Words can be <em>italicised</em> (i.e., emphasised) by putting a single
asterisk on either side of the word.</li>
<li>Words can be <strong>bolded</strong> (i.e., strongly-emphasised) by putting
double-quotes on either side of the word.</li>
<li>Links can be made to other wiki pages, by putting the file-name of the
target wiki page in double-square-brackets: i.e., [[ ]]</li>
</ul>
<p>allocPSA has been written such that any programmer can &quot;drop-in&quot; a new
wiki syntax. At the moment, the code needs to be modified in order for
this to happen. The allocPSA development team hopes to eventually make
it easy to make this change via a config option.</p>

<div class="section" id="inbox">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id161">13.10&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Inbox</a></h2>
<p>allocPSA provides a facility for accessing the current Inbox for the
primary account used to sent mail to the gateway.</p>
<p>Normally, this Inbox contains all the mail incoming into allocPSA, which
allocPSA then processes and remove from the Inbox. However, there are
occasions when that email can't be properly processed by allocPSA, such
as when there are no identifying mechanisms in the email header (e.g, a
missing 'key'). Under these circumstances, email isn't processed, and
accumulates in the Inbox. The allocPSA Inbox tool exists to allow an
allocPSA super-user administrator to manage this accumulated mail,
manually.</p>
<div class="section" id="inbox-table">
<h3><a class="toc-backref" href="#id162">13.10.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Inbox Table</a></h3>
<p>The allocPSA mail Inbox is presented as a table, with a number of data
columns:</p>
<table border="1" class="docutils">

<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id164">13.11&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tools</a></h2>
<p>In general, most of the tools on this tab provide additional management and
resource information, allow for customisation and offer your firm a framework
into which you can add your own, site-specific add-ons to your organisation's
allocPSA server.</p>
<p>The Finance section is the gateway to most of allocPSA's finance modules.
It contains reasonably complicated functions which most users don't need to
access. In general, only the user's TF account and Expense Forms need to be
accessed by regular/employee users.</p>
<p>Part of almost any professional services organisation is the management of the
finances associated with the Projects and Tasks which constitute the daily
operations of the organisation. As a Professional Services Automation system,
allocPSA includes a modular and flexible finance management system whose
purpose is to provide the conduit for any and all financial transactions with
the professional services organisation's accounting software. As such, allocPSA
offers the necessary modules to conduct financial transactional activities
within allocPSA (for Time Sheets, for Project-related Expense Forms etc) as well
as a shadow of many of the financial transactional activities which are found
in standard modern business accounting systems, such as invoicing, cost-centre
and wages management. As with many other aspects of allocPSA, non-privileged
users will be shown a simplified view of the Finance section, while managers and
administrative users will see the full offering.</p>
<p>Reminder: A Tagged Fund (TF) is an allocPSA term referring to the per-Project,
per-group/division or per-staff-member cost-centre which is tracked and managed
by allocPSA.</p>
<p>Non-privileged users will be offered these items: TF List, New Expense Form,
Search Invoices, View Pending Expense Forms and Search Transactions. Privileged
users can also see the following items: Approve Invoices, Allocate Invoices,
New Transaction, Upload Expenses File, New TF, Push
Repeating Expenses Through, Upload Wages Files, Reconciliation Report, View
Pending Transaction.</p>

<p>When new staff or Projects that need a corresponding TF cost-centre are added
to allocPSA, you can create such accounts from this section of the Finance
area. By default, for staff cost-centres, allocPSA uses a standard Payroll ID
based on a product call QuickPayroll, part of the QuickBooks accounting system.
This number would need to be reconfigured for your site's specific requirements
and accounting software. The instructions below would generally apply however.</p>

<h4><a class="toc-backref" href="#id167">13.11.1.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;List of Tagged Funds</a></h4>
<p>allocPSA has the ability to track internal cost-centres (or Tagged Funds, known
within the program as TFs) for expenses and revenues related to Projects, staff
and business units.</p>
<p>If you are a normal user, a TF is your personal cost-centre account. The TF is
the account into which Time Sheet payments are made (credited) and from which
expense items are taken out of (debited) upon reimbursements.</p>
<p>If you are a manager, you may also be shown any TF cost-centres which have been
allocated to you (among possibly other managers users) to manage.</p>
<p>Within the TF List page, there are:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>TF Name</li>
<li>Description</li>
<li>Balance and</li>
<li>Three specific action, namely 1. Statement 2. Repeating Expenses and 3. Edit

allocPSA, using a variety of search options.</p>
<p>There are a number of ways to search the transaction database stored within
allocPSA:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Firstly, you can choose the cost-centre TF of any Project or staff member,
from the drop list.</li>
<li>You can also select the status of the transactions from the drop list.
Options include All, Pending, Rejected and Approved.</li>
<li>You can supply the period sought through dates in YYYY-MM-DD format.</li>
<li>You can also enter the Transaction ID or Expense Form ID directly.</li>
</ol>
<p>You can also apply the various search criteria in combinations. allocPSA will

<p>As an example of the kinds of functional extensions that can be made within
allocPSA, the Simple Cost &amp; Time Estimator is provided, and documented here. It
is envisaged that this utility will not be of direct use to most users of
allocPSA. It is hoped that by providing this simple utility as an example, your
organisation will be inspired to visualise and eventually add your own set of
tools which can be used by your staff, to assist in day-to-day&nbsp; operations at
your organisation.</p>
<p>Based on a set of pre-determined programming and database languages, it is
possible to input various values for the scope and size of a particular
web-based database application, and this Estimator will produce a pre-figured
determination of the best-effort time and cost estimation, along with a spread
of values, based on number of resources. The values generated are based on a
pre-computed seed metric, derived from several years' evaluation of similarly
scoped Projects.</p>

<p class="caption">You have the ability to add your own skill types and
levels, and categorise your resources against those skill types.</p>
</div>
<p>This tool allows you to review, filter and drill down into the various
skillsets of your resource list as known by allocPSA. Whilst the samples
provided and screenshots shown display IT-related skills, this module can be
configured to handle any type of skill set.</p>
<p>You can use the first droplist to select a primary (i.e. broad) skill type,
then press the 'Filter' button. You should now be able to drill down into the
sub-categorised skills by selecting from the secondary drop-list, once again
pressing the 'Filter' button. At any stage, you can print the resulting matrix.</p>

<h4><a class="toc-backref" href="#id184">13.11.2.8&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Task Comment Templates</a></h4>
<p>In allocPSA, Task Comment Templates are used primarily as a form of open-ended
checklist system, allowing particular types of Tasks to be created quickly.</p>
<p>The Templates are created for oft-repeated jobs and Tasks. They can be enacted
when creating new Tasks.</p>
<p>When creating a new comment for a Task, you have the option
of invoking a pre-existing template for the text comment. This is useful if
there is a set routine or process which the person who has been allocated
the Task needs to undertake.</p>
<p>Task Comment Templates are create by pressing the 'New Comment/Template' link.
Simply fill in the Name for this new template, and supply the check list
content in the Text section. You can be as detailed as you like. Adding text
which appears like bullet-points is a good idea. When ready, press the 'Save'
button.</p>
<p>You can add new templates, which then become available from
a droplist in new Tasks. These templates can have place-holders, such as
Company Contact Details, Project Name etc, and allocPSA will replace these
place-holders with real values.</p>
<p>You can also edit and delete a Task Template by select it from the list, making
modifications and pressing the 'Save' button, or pressing the 'Delete' button.</p>

<div class="section" id="reports">
<h4><a class="toc-backref" href="#id186">13.11.2.10&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reports</a></h4>
<p>allocPSA provides an open and flexible way in which you can extract data from
its database. This is managed through the Reports interface.</p>
<p>Reporting allows you to select which tables, fields and criteria you want to
sort and filter data out from your allocPSA database. The data can be displayed
on-screen within the web browser, or bundled into a text-based Comma Separated
Value (CSV) or TAB delimited file, for downloading to your computer. This data
can then be inserted into applications like Microsoft Excel, OpenOffice.org
Calc (<a class="reference external" href="http://openoffice.org/">http://openoffice.org/</a>), Crystal Reports, Microsoft Access or other
reporting tools.</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Click the 'Reports' link on the allocPSA toolbar to go to the Report page.</li>
<li>Select which module you want to report on (Clients, Tasks etc.)</li>
<li>Press the 'Show Fields' button.</li>
<li>allocPSA will now display all the database table fields which pertain to
that module.</li>
<li>If you want to pull data out of any particular field, you need to click its
corresponding checkbox.</li>
<li>If you want to enact any filtering on that field, for instance, in answer to
the question 'Show me all Clients companies which have names starting with
the word HyperGlobalMegaNet', you would use the following filter criteria:
HyperGlobalMegaNet%</li>
<li>Alternatively, you can specify number ranges, upper and lower, using the
supplied numeric criteria fields.</li>
<li>Scroll down to the bottom and press the 'Dump Fields' button.</li>
<li>This will now dump the resulting records to your browser screen, below the
fields and selection criteria.</li>
<li>You can choose which suitable you use as the 'Group By' aggregator, by
selecting the choice button next to its title.</li>
<li>You can also elect to put quotes around the field data (handy when dealing
with data which has commas etc.) by selecting the option from the 'Quotes
around fields' droplist.</li>
<li>Rather than dumping the resulting dataset to the browser, you can tick the
'Generate File' checkbox and allocPSA will supply the resulting dataset in
the form of a text file.</li>
<li>You can also select a number of delimiters, comma (,), TAB (tab),
double-hash (##) etc, which you can then use to separate your fields when
you pull them into your report analysis application, or mail-merge
facility.</li>

<h4><a class="toc-backref" href="#id187">13.11.2.11&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Database &amp; File Backup</a></h4>
<p>allocPSA allows super-users to create database and uploaded file backups, and
then subsequently download, upload or restore a backup file.</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Click the 'Database &amp; File Backup' link on the allocPSA Tools tab to go to
the backup page.</li>
<li>Click the 'Create New Backup' button.</li>
<li>A list of generated backup files will appear, (you can have multiple
backups).</li>
<li>If you click the link for the backup file, you can download the file to
your computer.</li>
<li>If you click the 'Restore' button next to a backup file, that backup file
will be used to overwrite your current allocPSA database and file uploads.
Be careful with this feature. (A backup will be auto-created before all
'Restore' operations).</li>
<li>You can choose to clear up some space by removing a backup file by clicking
the 'Delete' button.</li>
<li>You can download a backup file, unzip it, edit it, zip it back up, and then
re-upload it using the 'Upload Backup Zip File' button, and then restore that
newly uploaded backup using the 'Restore' button.</li>
</ol>
<p>NOTE: Be very careful using this feature. Especially when mixing and matching
different versions of allocPSA as restoring a backup file from an earlier
release of allocPSA onto a new release probably isn't going to work.</p>
<p>NOTE: Sometimes the PHP memory limit of your webserver will need to be
increased to allow for large files and databases.</p>
