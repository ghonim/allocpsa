<b>Which TF to Credit</b> 
<br><br> 

The Tagged Fund name which is shown will be the one which the money from this
Time Sheet will be deposited into. If that is the incorrect TF account, or there is no TF shown
then go to your user account settings page and select your 'Preferred Payment TF'.
<br><br>

If there are no entries in the Preferred Payment TF dropdown box on your
person page, then you will need to be added as an owner of a particular TF. Go
to tools and either add a new TF, or view an existing one. At the bottom of the
TF editing page you will be able to add yourself as an owner of that TF.
