Some of these words *are emphasized*.

Use two asterisks for **strong emphasis**.

Lists

Unordered (bulleted) lists use asterisks, 
pluses, and hyphens (*, +, and -) as list 
markers. These three markers are interchangable.

 * Candy.
 * Gum.
 * Booze.

Ordered (numbered) lists use regular numbers, followed by periods, as list markers:

 1. Red
 2. Green
 3. Blue


To make links you surround a word [[with double brackets]].
