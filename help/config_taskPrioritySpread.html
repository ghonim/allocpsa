<u>Task Priority Spread</u>
<br><br>
 
This configuration value affects the shape of the task priority curve.

<br><br>
The lower the spread value, the more dramatic the effect the target completion date has on priority.
<br><br>

Conversely a higher value here flattens out the curve, reducing the effect that time has on a priority value.

<br><br>

A sensible default might be 20.
