<u>Default Task Limit</u>
<br><br>

Enter a number of hours here. This sets up a default for the Task Limit field on newly created tasks.

<br><br>

When the Task Limit field is set, time sheets for that task will be flagged
with a warning should the time spent on that task exceed the Task Limit.

<br><br>

For example entering 5 as the Default Task Limit, indicates the Limit field
on newly created tasks will default to 5. When time is added to a time sheet
for that task, and the effort spent on that task exceeds 5 hours, then a
warning is flagged on the time sheet.

<br><br>

This functionality helps set expectations about the amount of time that can be
spent on tasks.
