<u>Update Exchange Rates</u>
<br><br>

Please ensure that you have set up and activated the currencies that you intend to use on the 
<b>Setup -> Miscellaneous -> Currency Types -> Edit</b> screen.
<br><br>

When you are satisfied that you have only activated the currencies
that you want to use, you can click this button which will download
today's exchange rates.
<br><br>

You may see some errors if you've already downloaded the rates for
today. Once the rate has been downloaded for a particular source
currency to destination currency for a particular date, it cannot be
downloaded again.
