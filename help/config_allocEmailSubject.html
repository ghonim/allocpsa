%cn = Company Name<br>
%c1 = Company Address (line 1)<br>
%c2 = Company Address (line 2)<br>
%c3 = Company Address (line 3)<br>
%ce = Company Email<br>
%cp = Company Phone No<br>
%cf = Company Fax No<br>
%cw = Company Home Page<br>
<br>
Additional substitutions are available for task, time sheet and reminder subject lines.
