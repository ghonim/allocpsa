<u>allocPSA Email Gateway</u>

<br><br>

<b>Optionally</b> enter this infomation to enable the allocPSA Email Gateway.

<br><br>
If you decide to enable this functionality, ensure you use a dedicated mailbox.
<br><br>
Here's an example of this useful functionality in action:
<br><br>

<style>
.dp li { margin-bottom:10px; }

</style>
<ul class="dp">
<li>Alex adds a comment to a task, but just before clicking save, Alex ensures that the checkbox to email the comment to Bill is checked.
<li>The comment is subsequently added to the task and Bill receives Alex's email - <b>Note: that email is *from* the address that you enter in the "From Address" box.</b>
<li>Bill decides to reply to Alex's email, but he doesn't want to login to allocPSA... so Bill hits "Reply" in his email client, types a message and clicks "Send".
<li>Since the email was <b>from the address that you enter in the "From Address" box</b>, the email gets sent straight to the mailbox that you've set up allocPSA to check.
<li>allocPSA checks the mailbox and sees that there is new mail from Bill.
<li>allocPSA adds Bills email as a comment on the relevant task, complete with any email attachments.
<li>allocPSA then re-emails Bill's comment to Alex.
</ul>

Alex can then reply to that email if he likes and the whole conversation can bounce backwards and forwards through email, all the while getting logged to the relevant task.

To activate this functionality, fill in the information on this page, and
also ensure that you've set up a re-occurring automated job (eg cronjob) to hit
the email fetching script: http://YOUR_ALLOC/email/receiveEmail.php  We
recommend hitting that script about every five minutes.
