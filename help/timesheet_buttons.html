line entries that you have entered will be deleted.

You will only see this button here if a Manager has been selected for this
particular Project.  This button will save the current Time Sheet and submit it
to the Manager.  You will not be able to edit this Time Sheet any further if you
click this button, unless the Project Manager rejects it and decides to make the
Time Sheet editable again for some reason.

<b>To Admin</b></br>
This button will save the current Time Sheet and submit it to the Time
Sheet Administrator.  You will not be able to edit this Time Sheet any further
if you click this button, unless the Time Sheet Administrator rejects it and

again.
