<u>Email Addressing Method</u><br></br>
These options allow you to select the method in which emails that are sent by allocPSA, are addressed to people.
<br><br>

<b>Use "To:"</b><br>
When an email goes out to multiple recipients, each persons email address
will appear in the "To:" header of the email. This is quite normal.

<br><br>

<b>Use "Bcc:"</b><br>
When an email goes out to multiple recipients, each persons email address
will be put in the "Bcc:" header of the email instead of the regular "To:" header.
<br><br>
This has the effect of hiding the email addresses of the recipients from
each other. I.e. the recipients do not get visibility on who else the email was
sent to.

<br><br>

<b>Use Both with special "To:"</b><br>

When this option is selected the email addresses of the recipients are put
into the "Bcc:" header same as the previous option. However instead of the
"To:" header being left blank, it is populated with the *names* of the
recipients - but *not* their email addresses.

<br><br>

This has the effect of allowing each recipient of the email to see who the
other recipients are, but not their email addresses.

<br><br>

Unfortunately not all email *sending* servers support this fully standards
compliant (RFC 2822) form of the "To:" header, that is why we have provided
this mechanism to disable it.
