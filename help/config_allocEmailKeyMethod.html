<u>allocPSA Mail Key Method</u>
<br><br>
If incoming emails are not being added as Task Comments for some reason, it
could be because the people who are sending mail into the system are using
email clients that don't adhere to a standardised email format.  Switch this
option over to "Email Subject" if you have a surplus of these users, and the
key which identifies which Task to insert Comments into etc, will be stored
simply on the subject line of emails, instead of embedded in the Message-ID
header.
