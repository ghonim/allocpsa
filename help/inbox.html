<b>Manage Inbox</b>

<br><br>
If email is sent directly to the alloc mailbox and it doesn't have a {Key:foobar} in
the subject line, (or alloc doesn't know how to process the email for some
other reason), then it will remain here in the inbox.

<br><br>

(Normally the inbox is cleared out by a periodic job which hits http://YOURALLOC/email/receiveEmail.php)

<br><br>
Here's what the buttons do:

<br><br>
<b>Archive</b><br>
Move the email to an archive folder where it will be out of the way.

<br><br>
<b>New Task</b><br>
Create a new task from the email. Subject line becomes the
Task's Name, the body of the email becomes the Task's Description.
Any attachments in the email will be extracted and stored as task attachments.

<br><br>
<b>Existing Task</b><br>
Create a comment on an <b>existing</b> task. Enter the task ID of an existing task.
Select to whom the comment should be emailed. Click the Go button.

<br><br>
<b>Process</b><br>
Push the email through the same process that it would undergo if it had been
received by alloc under normal circumstances. Eg: create a task comment, send
to recipients etc. Running this function may be useful to see why a particular
email is erroring out.

<br><br>
<b>Download</b><br>
Fetch the complete email for download.

<br><br>
<b>Mark Read / Mark Unread</b><br>
Toggle an email's "seen" flag. Only messages that aren't "seen" get processed by
alloc's receiveEmail.php job.
