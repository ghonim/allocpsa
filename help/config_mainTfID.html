<u>Finance Tagged Fund</u>
<br><br>
 
This is the default fallback fund for allocPSA transactions. 
<br><br>

Time Sheets use this Fund to withdraw money from (if the Time Sheets
Project doesn't have a default Tagged Fund set up already).
<br><br>

Additionally Invoices and Expense Forms use this TF by default to deposit
money into.
