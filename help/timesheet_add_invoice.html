<b>Attached To Invoice</b>
<br><br>
There are two main scenarios for when a Time Sheet is attached to an
Invoice.
<br><br>

The first more common scenario is when multiple Time Sheets are created first,
and then an Invoice is created from those Time Sheets.
<br><br>

This is useful for allowing many employees to log their time, and then
generating an Invoice to be sent to the Client for those funds.
<br><br>

The second workflow is more complicated but it allows you to track a Pre-paid
Invoice. I.e. when a Client has already approved work of up to X amount, and
employees are able to log their time up to that amount, without going over the
amount that the Client has specified.
<br><br>

This is supported by:
<br><br>

1) Changing the Type of a Project to: "Pre-paid". This has the effect of
automatically attaching all Time Sheets that are then created for this Project, onto
the relevant Invoice.
<br><br>

If no Invoice is found an error will display and the user will be unable to
create the Time Sheet.
<br><br>

2) Create an Invoice for that Client and optionally that Project. Set the
Invoices "Pre-paid Amount" field, to the maximum amount that that Invoice is
for.
<br><br>

3) Employees fill in Time Sheets and are able to see how much the total sum of
all Time Sheets are for that Invoice as well as how much is allocated.
<br><br>

4) Users are not allowed to add Time Sheet Items if adding those items
pushes the sum of the Amount Used for that Invoice higher than the Amount
Allocated.
