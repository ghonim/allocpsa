<b>Time Sheet Commissions</b>
<br><br>

Commissions can be added here so that when Time Sheets are billed for this
Project, a percentage of the funds from the Time Sheet will go to the nominated
TF. 
<br><br>

If you enter zero as the commission percentage, it will signify that "all
the remaining funds" from a time sheet will be allocated (after the other
commissions have been paid).
