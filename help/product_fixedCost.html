<b>Product Costs</b>
<br><br>

Enter any costs associated with the product. For example, the cost of
acquiring the product, the postage and handling, and fixed commissions
etc.

<br><br>

The Sell Price minus the sum of all the fixed Product Costs, will be the
margin/profit from the sale.

<br><br>

For example: If the Sell Price is $100 and you have two product costs:
$60 to acquire the item, and $10 postage. Then the margin/profit will be $30.

<br><br>

The margin/profit will be later distributed based on the Product
Commissions percentages that you set up below.
