<u>Services Tax Percent</u>
<br><br>

The value of your countries goods and services tax, for example in Australia it
is currently 10%.  This percentage is used within the Time Sheets. Eg, a client
is invoiced at a rate which is inclusive of this tax, but when dividing the
funds up the value that gets allocated is excluding this tax.
