<u>Main Currency</u>
<br><br>
 
This is the default currency as used in alloc. To modify the list that appears
in the dropdown you may want to go to Setup - Miscellaneous - Currency
Types and make certain currencies active or inactive.

<br><br>

If you are updating from a previous version of alloc that did not have support
for currencies, you may want to select your preferred currency from the
dropdown and click the "Update Transactions That Have No Currency" button.
<br><br>

Th old-style monetary transactions (that don't have a currency at all), will then be
stored as the selected currency.
