<b>Create a reminder for this task</b>
<br><br>

Selecting this option will create a reminder for the assignee of this task,
based on the task's priority. 
<br><br>
This will mean that the assignee receives an email about the task as soon
as it is created, and a reminder until the task is closed (or the reminder
deleted).

<br><br>

This can be used, for example, to make sure phone messages are acted on.
