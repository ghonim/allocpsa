how much cost and time is remaining for all the incomplete Tasks. 
<br><br>
Eg: Task Quote: $100.00 / 5.0 Hours (4 incomplete, 2 not included)

There is $100 worth of work left, and it should only take 5 hours.
Also, there are 4 tasks yet to be completed and of those, 2 of them cannot
be included in this Task Quote because they haven't got Time Estimates filled in.
