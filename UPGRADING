allocPSA Upgrading
==================

To determine which version you are currently running, look at the fine print at
the bottom of the login screen for allocPSA, or alternatively view the file

http://YOUR_ALLOC_INSTALLATION/util/alloc_version


Generic Upgrade Instructions
----------------------------

1. Backup your allocPSA database. DO IT NOW.


2. Unpack the new allocPSA source code alongside your current installation.


3. Copy the alloc_config.php file from your current installation of
   allocPSA into the directory that contains the new installation of allocPSA.


4. Finally, update your allocPSA database by going to this address in your web
   browser: http://YOUR_NEW_ALLOC_INSTALLATION/installation/patch.php

   Apply each patch separately, starting from the top and working your way down.
   If you get errors stop the process and use the support forums.



To upgrade from 1.2.256 to 1.3.508 - The Safe Way
-------------------------------------------------

1. Completely replace the old allocPSA source code in the webserver
   document root, with the new source code.


2. Visit an address in your webbrowser for the first part of the upgrade:

   http://YOUR_ALLOC_INSTALLATION/installation/patch_1_2_256_to_1_3_497.php

   Follow the instructions carefully. Refresh the page every time you make a
   change, the todo list should get shorter everytime you've made a change and
   then refreshed the page.


3. After you follow all the instructions there, you will be given a link to
   go to complete the database upgrade. Something like:

   http://YOUR_ALLOC_INSTALLATION/installation/patch.php

   Ensure you only visit this link, once you have been told to by
   completing everything on step 2 - otherwise this step may fail.

   Once you've visited this link, click all the check boxes on the page
   (sorry), and click the button at the bottom to apply the ticked changes.
   My advice would be to start at the top and tick a few at a time, so that if
   there are any errors popping it will make it easier to determine which
   database patch is causing the problem.

   Once they've all been applied and there are no more checkboxes to tick,
   refresh the page a couple times and you should get taken to the login
   screen. If you got errors at any stage then let us know about them.


4. If you previously had cronjobs installed for the reminders, repeating
   transactions, or daily digest emails, you should remove them and install
   these new simpler ones (these should be a little more portable to windows).

   # Check every 10 minutes for any allocPSA Reminders to send
   */10 * * * * wget -q -O /dev/null http://YOUR_ALLOC_INSTALLATION/reminder/sendReminders.php

   # Send allocPSA Daily Digest emails once a day at 4:35am
   35 4 * * * wget -q -O /dev/null http://YOUR_ALLOC_INSTALLATION/person/sendEmail.php

   # Check for allocPSA Repeating Expenses once a day at 4:40am
   40 4 * * * wget -q -O /dev/null http://YOUR_ALLOC_INSTALLATION/finance/checkRepeat.php



To upgrade from 1.2.256 to 1.3.508 - The Quick Way (need root shell access)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. As the root user, run these commands:
      cd YOUR_ALLOC_INSTALLATION/util/
      chmod a+x ./patch.sh
      ./patch.sh http://YOUR_ALLOC_INSTALLATION/

   You should get a whole lot of output on the screen. 

2. Run that last command again:
      ./patch.sh http://YOUR_ALLOC_INSTALLATION/

   You should get very little output on the screen. Make sure the second last line says: eval ''

3. Double check that all the database patches got applied, do something like:
      mysql -u root DATABASENAME -e "SELECT patchName FROM patchLog"

   There should be a list of 40 patch files.

4. Lastly, don't forget to manually update the cronjobs as specified in step 4 above.
