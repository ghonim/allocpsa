Hints and Tips on developing allocPSA
=====================================


Version Control
---------------

allocPSA uses darcs for version control. To check out a copy of the latest
version just run:

$ darcs get http://dev.allocpsa.net/

To commit changes back to the project, just run 

$ darcs send

Which should email the changes back to the correct place, at which point the
changes will be given a once-over and then merged back into the development
repository.

When recording changes, don't use the darcs long comment, instead try to
succinctly describe your change in one line of text. 

You may prefix that commit message with one or more descriptive keywords,
that are always uppercase. Currently we're using the following keywords: DOCS,
COSMETIC, CLI, BUG, JSON, REFACTOR, SOAP you can also put in an issue id from
the issue tracker if able.


Rebuilding the CSS Files
------------------------

In the css/ directory there are css files for each theme. 

When manipulating css you do *not* need to change those files. You just
need to change the files in the css/src/ directory and then run `make css` which
should rebuild the css files.

css/src/style.tpl    ->  contains the template of the main CSS file
css/src/style_*.ini  ->  contains the actual settings that get plugged into the template


Updating the Help document
--------------------------

The plaintext file help/src/help.txt contains the "source code" to the help
documents that are generated both for the html Help document that is linked to
within allocPSA, and the PDF Help document that is available for download at
sourceforge.

Simply change the help.txt file and then run `make doc_html` or `make doc_pdf`.
You will need to have docutils/rst2html installed. On Ubuntu there is a package
called python-docutils that will install rst2html.


Vim Settings
------------

It is strongly recommended to use the following setting in your .vimrc. 

set expandtab
set softtabstop=2
set tabstop=2
set foldmethod=marker
set sw=2
let php_folding=1

If you wish to only enable these settings when working on the alloc project
one way to do that is to have a snippet like this in your ~/.vimrc:

if version >= 501
  if getcwd() =~ 'alloc.*'
    source alloc_vimrc
  endif
endif

And store the custom settings in that alloc_vimrc file.
